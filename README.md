# 📰 News Hunter  

News Hunter is a **news aggregator web application** that fetches and displays the latest headlines from popular Indian news sources like **The Economic Times, The Hindu, and NDTV**.  

It provides a clean and interactive interface where users can quickly browse news, read article summaries, and open full articles in one click.

## 📌 Problem  
Staying updated with daily news can be challenging. For example, my father likes to read the news every day, but no single newspaper covers everything. To stay informed, he has to browse through multiple newspapers and websites, which is inefficient and time-consuming.  

## 💡 Solution – NewsHunter  
To solve this problem, I built **NewsHunter**, a web application that aggregates headlines from India’s top newspapers into a single platform. With NewsHunter, users can:  
- Read the latest headlines across multiple sources in one place.  
- Access full articles directly from the news source.  
- Interact with an integrated **Gemini-powered chatbot** to discuss or analyze the news.  
- Create and save **personal notes** while browsing.  

This makes news consumption faster, simpler, and more engaging.
